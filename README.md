# MovieLister
This program provides an interface for someone to keep track of the movies they watch and what date they've watched them. 
I'm writing this to learn C#


13 Jan, 2015 - Added a menu bar and added code to execute in the File Menu. Also added logicv to the Close button on 
               the form so that it will check to see if there is anything in the database and prompt user to save if it
               finds content.
               
               
               
               
               ABOUT
  This is a simple program that allows users to create a table of movies they've seen and when they have seen them. It provides
  the ability to add and delete movies and to search for movies by title.
  
              FUTURE PLANS
  1. Add the ability to edit entries in the table.
  2. create a fork that saves the data to SQLExpress or another DB.
